Creating Flash Animation and Publishing into WebPage:

1. Flash Document is saved with Extention	
	"offer.fla"
2. ".fla" can't be uploaded into page. It is for editing your animation later.

3. To place in a web page you have to export into ".swf"
	
  File Menu → Export → Export Movie

	"offer.swf"
4. Flash animations are added to page by using <embed> tag

 Syntax:
  <embed src="path" width="" height="">


Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Flash Ads</title>
    <style>    
    
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h2>Amazon Shopping</h2>
      <header>
        <embed width="100%" src="../Images/offer.swf">
      </header>
  </body>
</html>
